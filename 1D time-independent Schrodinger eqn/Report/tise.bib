	abstract = {An alternative formulation of the “shooting” method for a numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation is described for cases of general asymmetric one-dimensional potential (planar geometry), and spherically symmetric potential. The method relies on matching the asymptotic wavefunctions and the potential core region wavefunctions, in course of finding bound states energies. It is demonstrated in the examples of Morse and Kratzer potentials, where a high accuracy of the calculated eigenvalues is found, together with a considerable saving of the computation time.}
